# Algorithimic Thinking
### Algorithimic thinking is an approach to problemsolving that follows the following structure for breaking a problem down:

## -- > Input -- > Problem -- > Output

### This by breaking up a problem by clearly a distinct set of steps from going from input to output.

# Algorithm
## 1. The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order.

## 2. The steps also need to be distinct.

## 3. The algorithm should produce a result.

## The algorithm should complete in a finit amount of time.
